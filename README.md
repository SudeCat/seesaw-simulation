# üéØ Seesaw Physics Simulation

A realistic seesaw simulation built with vanilla JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. Experience physics in action as you drop objects and watch the seesaw tilt based on weight distribution and torque calculations.

## ‚ú® Features

### üéÆ Interactive Physics
- **Real-time Physics**: Objects affect seesaw balance based on weight and distance from center
- **Torque Calculations**: Accurate physics simulation using weight √ó distance formulas
- **Visual Feedback**: See tilt angles and weight distributions in real-time

### üéØ Multiple Interaction Methods
- **Direct Seesaw Click**: Click directly on the seesaw plank to place objects
- **Stage Area Click**: Click anywhere in the white stage area to drop objects from above
- **Smart Positioning**: Objects automatically go to the correct side based on click position

### üé® Visual Effects
- **Drop Animations**: Smooth falling animations when objects are dropped
- **Realistic Physics**: Objects stick to the seesaw surface
- **Dynamic Sizing**: Object size changes based on weight (heavier = bigger)
- **Color Coding**: Object colors change based on weight intensity

### üìä Real-time Information
- **Weight Tracking**: Monitor left and right side weights
- **Tilt Angle**: See the current seesaw angle in degrees
- **Next Weight**: Preview the weight of the next object
- **Action Log**: Track all your interactions

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites
- Modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge)
- No additional dependencies required!

### Installation
1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/seesaw-simulation.git
   cd seesaw-simulation
   ```

2. **Open in browser**
   ```bash
   # Option 1: Simple file opening
   open index.html
   
   # Option 2: Local server (recommended)
   python -m http.server 8000
   # Then visit http://localhost:8000
   ```

3. **Start experimenting!**
   - Click on the seesaw or white area to drop objects
   - Watch the physics in action
   - Try to balance the seesaw!

## üéÆ How to Use

### Basic Controls
1. **Drop Objects**: Click anywhere on the seesaw or white stage area
2. **Reset**: Click the "Reset Seesaw" button to clear all objects
3. **Balance**: Try to get equal weights on both sides for a horizontal seesaw

### Physics Understanding
- **Equal Weights + Equal Distances = 0¬∞ Tilt** (Horizontal)
- **Different Distances = Different Torques = Tilt**
- **Heavier Objects = More Torque = More Tilt**

### Tips for Best Experience
- Place objects at similar distances from center for balanced seesaw
- Watch the console for detailed physics calculations
- Use the action log to track your experiments

## üîß Technical Details

### Physics Engine
- **Torque Calculation**: `Torque = Weight √ó Distance from Center`
- **Angle Calculation**: `Angle = (Right Torque - Left Torque) / Tilt Factor`
- **Real-time Updates**: Physics recalculated on every object placement

### Browser Compatibility
- ‚úÖ Chrome 60+
- ‚úÖ Firefox 55+
- ‚úÖ Safari 12+
- ‚úÖ Edge 79+

### Performance
- **Lightweight**: Pure vanilla JavaScript (no frameworks)
- **Fast Rendering**: Optimized CSS animations
- **Responsive**: Works on desktop and mobile devices
